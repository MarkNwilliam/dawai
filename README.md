# Dawai - Medicine Locator and Pharmacy Management Software for Sudan ðŸ’ŠðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©âœ¨

Dawai is a project with an ambition of providing aid to the Sudanese populous in finding medicine. It locates the medicine using a shared DB with 4000+ medicine records (including brands, categories, manufacturer etc.), a management UI for Pharmacies to put their inventory in and gives them control over their products' exposure to the public (not a single byte of info is displayed without the pharmacies' owners consent).

To even contribute more to the Sudanese populous, Dawai is completely Open Source and commits 100% transparency on all levels. Even our backend is, check it out [here](https://www.github.com/phr3nzy/dawai-backend).

This repository contains the Frontend of Dawai (not the landnig page, it's [here](https://www.github.com/phr3nzy/dawai-landing)). Built using Vue, Vuetify & Nuxt!
